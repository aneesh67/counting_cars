ðŸš— Vehicle Detection, Counting & Speed Estimation

This project is an AI-powered traffic monitoring system that detects, counts, and tracks vehicles in real-time using YOLOv8 and a custom-built tracking algorithm. It not only counts vehicles moving in both directions but also estimates their speed, identifies overspeed violations, and generates visual analytics for traffic insights.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8

Custom tracker to assign unique IDs and avoid double-counting

Speed estimation based on vehicle crossing times between two reference lines

Overspeed detection & snapshots of violating vehicles (saved automatically)

CSV logging of vehicle details (ID, direction, speed, timestamp)

Visualization outputs:

Vehicle count by direction

Speed distribution histogram

Average speed by direction

Top 5 fastest vehicles

Speed trends over time

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection

Custom Tracker (tracker.py) for vehicle ID management

CSV + Plots for structured analytics

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

YOLOv8 detects vehicles in each video frame.

Tracker.py assigns consistent IDs to detected vehicles.

Speed is calculated using time taken to cross two reference lines and a predefined real-world distance.

Overspeeding vehicles are highlighted in red, logged in CSV, and a snapshot is saved.

After processing, detailed visual reports are generated inside the visualizations/ folder.
